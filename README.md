# PythonLabCreateLoops

As a security analyst, some of the measures you take to protect a system will involve repetition. As
an example, you might need to investigate multiple IP addresses that have attempted to connect
to the network. In Python, iterative statements can help automate repetitive processes like these
to make them more efficient.

In this lab, you will practice writing iterative statements in Python.

Scenario:

You’re working as a security analyst, and you’re writing programs in Python to automate displaying
messages regarding network connection attempts, detecting IP addresses that are attempting to
access restricted data, and generating employee ID numbers for a Sales department.
